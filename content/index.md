<h1 class="main">I'm Dave...</h1>

## I think creatively, build systematically.

That's [enterprise platforms](#tags=enterprise) handling millions in assets. It's [open source](#tags=library) libraries that solve real problems. It's [browser extensions](#tags=chrome-extension) used by thousands. It's [writing](#path=/blog/&tags=featured) that actually helps people.

:home-thumbs{:featured="featured"}

I started out in [Animation](/archive/work/animation/) and [Flash](/archive/work/flash/), which taught me how things should *feel*. I've spent 10 years building [web applications](/work/), which taught me how things should *work*. Now I combine both to create experiences that are technically solid and genuinely enjoyable.

<!--

My stack is [Vue](/search?tags=vue), [Nuxt](/search?tags=nuxt), [TypeScript](/search?tags=typescript&tags=javascript&tagsOp=or), and [whatever else](/search/?tagsFilter=list) the problem needs. My approach is "what if...?" then iterate to the solution: shower thoughts become plans, become prototypes, become things.
