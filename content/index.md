<h1 class="main">I'm Dave,</h1>

## I bring a maker's eye with an engineer's hand<span class="hide-md-down">.</span>

I work on [enterprise platforms](?tags=enterprise) that handle millions in assets. I build [open source](?tags=library) libraries that solve real problems. I craft [browser extensions](?tags=chrome-extension) used by thousands. I write [original articles](?path=/blog/&tags=featured) that get shared.

:home-thumbs{:featured="featured"}

I started out in [Animation](/archive/work/animation/) and [Flash](/archive/work/flash/), which taught me how things should *feel*. I've spent 10 years building [web applications](/work/), which taught me how things should *work*.

Now I combine both to create eye-catching and satisfying experiences:

:media-gallery{media="gallery" captions scale keep-alive}

I work in the [Vue](/search?tags=vue) ecosystem with [Nuxt](/search?tags=nuxt), [TypeScript](/search?tags=typescript&tags=javascript&tagsOp=or), and [complimentary](/search/?tagsFilter=list) technologies.

Right now I specialise in UI architecture, component libraries, and design systems – but I'm just as comfortable working across the full application stack.

I'm available for contract work or permanent roles where I get to work across design, product, and engineering.
