# Bio

![img](images/dave-wide.jpg)

I'm one of those annoying people who ***loves*** what they do.

I'm constantly thinking of ways to build things, to connect things, how it could be better, or easier, or smoother, or cooler. Shower thoughts become notes, sketches, experiments, repos, releases, then...

And that's what I aim to bring to the [projects](/projects/) and [products](/products/) I work on.

## Background

I've had an interesting journey through tech; my background is [animation](/archive/work/animation/) and I cut my coding teeth in [3dsmax](/archive/projects/open-source/3dsmax/), [After Effects](/search/?tags=after-effects) and [Flash](/archive/work/flash/) – in what used to be a very creative TV and advertising agency landscape.

As I transitioned into pure web development, [ActionScript](/search/?tags=as3) became [JavaScript](/search/?tags=javascript), [MaxScripts](/archive/projects/open-source/3dsmax/) became [NPM packages](/projects/), and [micro-sites](/search/?text=micro) became [web applications](/work/).

There's been a mix of [front end](/search/?tags=frontend) and [back end](/search/?tags=backend) along the way, but right now [Node](/search/?tags=node), [TypeScript](/search/?tags=typescript) & [Vue](/search/?tags=vue) is my stack, with a preference for [Jamstack](/search/?tags=jamstack) / hybrid sites, [tooling](/search/?tags=tools) and [extensions](/search/?tags=chrome-extension). 

I've worked freelance, in teams, in small, medium and enterprise-sized companies, on short, medium and multi-year projects as what you might call a senior / lead web application developer.

## Right now

I'm focusing on the Indie Hacker dream; releasing my own software and hopefully growing it into a sustainable business:

Moving from developer to consumer/business tools is an interesting one; I've only recently started on this road so it's too early to make any predictions, but [Control Space](https://controlspace.app) has recently gone into public Beta  🥳.
