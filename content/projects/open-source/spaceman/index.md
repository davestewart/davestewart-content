# Spaceman

## Overview

[NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) workspaces provide a streamlined workflow to manage multiple packages within a single repository, but require a certain amount of knowledge, configuration and terminal-fu for everyday tasks.

Spaceman makes running complex or multistep tasks easier by wrapping them in prompts, and batching commands on confirmation.

Why read the docs when you can just answer questions?

## Usage

Once installed, run the package by typing `spaceman` then pick the task you want to run:

![cli-preview.png](./screens/tasks.png)

For example, creating new workspaces is easy; just answer the prompts and Spaceman will create all folders, package files, stub files and install dependencies:

![cli-preview.png](./screens/workspace.png)

Once created, it's easy to share with other workspaces too; just follow the prompts:

![cli-preview.png](./screens/share.png)
