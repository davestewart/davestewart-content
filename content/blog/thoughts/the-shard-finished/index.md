# The Shard, finished

As a Londoner, I'm lucky-enough to have the beautiful Shard just a stone's throw away; in fact I can even see it from my bedroom window at night.

But in all honesty, I'm not sure if the whole "shard" idea has really paid off - it just looks unfinished, especially when you get a view of it with the maintenance crane in shot.

So it's time to turn to PhotoShop to see how The Shard could have looked if they hadn't have been so fancy-schmancy with their clever ideas. Click the image below to see before and after shots...

Personally, I think The Shard with a point on top looks absolutely bad-ass.

But strangely, comparing the "finished-looking" shard to the "finished" version, makes me appreciate the shard-i-ness of the original a little more. Especially when it's [lit up at night](https://schietree.wordpress.com/tag/ancient-greece/#attachment_2335).
