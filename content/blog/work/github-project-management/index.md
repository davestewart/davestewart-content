# How I use GitHub's tools to manage my projects

### Project management

***Manage your project like your work***; I'd noticed that I seemed to get much more done at work vs home, so I simply adopted the same strategies and tools.

I'm a developer, so I use GitHub (which is [free for private projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/)) and you get a multitude of tools to keep on track and accountable. 

Note that **this was the single biggest change to forward momentum** since finding myself floundering when the project moved from small to medium sized.

# Plan

Get everything into Github:

- Document ideas and features as GitHub issues
- Create issue templates to provide consistency when documenting; I like: Background, Proposal, Notes

#### Organise

Use GitHub's free project management tools

- Add all feature ideas so you have a backlog to reference, review, and motivate you
- Use project boards to batch and work on issues
- Use Milestones as a poor man's "project areas" which you can order
- Use labels to differentiate features, bugs, etc, and find a system **that works for the project**

#### Update

Maintain the link between issues, branches and PRs:

- Use a branch naming scheme that correlate to issues numbers, i.e. `0123-simple-task-summary`
- Use Pull Requests to automatically close issues and update boards  
- Use squash commits to keep a clean history; once committed they show as `Simple Task Summary (#456)`
