Between 2000-2015 I released over 100 open source projects – MaxScript plugins for 3dsmax, jQuery and framework plugins, IDE extensions, Excel VBA tools, and more.

This was an incredibly prolific period of solving problems, sharing solutions, and building tools that made other developers' workflows easier.
