# Nocturnal Groove: Visuals

## Overview

Nocturnal, the record label behind Shapeshifter and [Lola's Theme](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kIC0aQ56ASE), asked me to do some visuals for their tent at the 2005 [Global Gathering](http://globalgathering.com/) festival, but unfortunately I was too busy. However I did manage to put together something funky for their monthly night at AKA / [The End](http://endclub.com/) here in London.

## Implementation

Keyframed animation in Adobe After Effects with judicious use of [Trapcode Particular](https://www.maxon.net/en/product-detail/red-giant/particles-and-3d/trapcode-particular).
