Before I was a developer, I was an animator. These projects represent years spent crafting broadcast idents, film titles, and club visuals in 3dsmax and After Effects.

It was actually MaxScript, building plugins, scripting animation and manipulating meshes that got me hooked on code and set me on the path to development.
