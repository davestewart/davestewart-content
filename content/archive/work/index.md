Before moving into application development, I spent years working in agencies building interactive campaigns, microsites, and branded experiences for major clients.

This was the height of Flash creativity – where animation, interactivity, and storytelling came together to create engaging digital experiences. We built everything from racing games for film launches to immersive bar microsites, broadcast prototypes to live event systems.

Before moving into interactive development, I spent years creating 3D animation and motion graphics for broadcast TV, film titles, and live events – the kind of work that taught me timing, storytelling, and visual polish before I ever touched a line of code.
