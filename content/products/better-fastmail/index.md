# Better FastMail

## Overview

The FastMail web client is fantastic, but has a few UX/UI quirks that could be improved:

- Common [keyboard shortcuts](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360058753534-Keyboard-shortcuts) are not exactly intuitive
- The editor component does not [properly support indented text](https://twitter.com/dave_stewart/status/1512472229220700171)
- The main menu takes too many clicks to switch accounts

## Improvements

### Better UI

Folders

- Nesting indentation is more obvious

Editor

- Blockquote styling has been reset so indents look like indents (and not quoted replies)

Main Menu

- Switch users directly from the main menu dropdown

### Better shortcuts
